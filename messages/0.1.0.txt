SendToSandbox - 0.1.0
=====================

The idea of this plugin is to use a file as a _SandBox_. A file to which you send "stuff" you want remember or just you wanna store
somewhere rapidly. Somewhere like a clipboard but more consisent.
Right now you can (and must) just specify a single file in the \ProgramFiles\Sublime Text 3\Data\Packages\User\SendToSandbox.sublime-settings file.

In this file, once you've sent something to it, you'll find all your texts, with a "title" (in markdown style) that is the name of the file where those lines were originally. At the end of the filename you'll find the line-numbers of the original lines.

This is a beta version, just to understand if someone needs it. I need it, and if I'm not the only one I'll improve it.
Feel free to send me advise or anything!
